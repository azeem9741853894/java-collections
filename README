collections:    example of impelmentation for Java Collections.

                Java Collections represents a unified framework for storing and
                manipulating groups of object.
                This implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic
                arrays, linked lists, etc.), compliant to the standard interface
                of the Java collection Framework (java.util), would be a way to
                learn about Java Generics.
